## About
Simple PCAP was created to allow the user to focus as much as possible on processing packets stored in 
a pcap file without studying its structure. This is a very simple tool, it does not provide additional 
tools for analyzing packages. The library tries to provide the safest possible manipulation of pcap files.


## Installation
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/ic-it/simplepcap.git
```

## Usage example
### Simple usage
```python
from pprint import pprint
from simplepcap.parsers import DefaultParser


with DefaultParser(file_path="./pcaps/eth-1.pcap") as parser:
    pprint(parser.file_header)
    for packet in parser:
        pprint(packet)
```

### Get all packets
```python
from pprint import pprint
from simplepcap.parsers import DefaultParser


with DefaultParser(file_path="./pcaps/eth-1.pcap") as parser:
    packets = list(parser) # or packets = parser.get_all_packets()

pprint(packets)
```
